# Loan prediction system
This repository is inspired by my capstone project for my master's degree program at Grand Canyon University. The project aims to create a "Data science product" such as a "Loan prediction system" for the bank sector. The product will automate the loan approval process as it focuses on reducing the manual time and effort involved in the loan approval process. This project evaluation measure or acceptance criteria are accurate and reduce false positives. 

# Program
The entire project is built using Python and then deployed using the Streamlit framework. Libraries like pickle, streamlit, NumPy, pandas, seaborn, and plotly were installed and imported for use.
